		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gay and I went to see The National at The Neptune Theater last night. It was a late night for us too, we didn't even leave the house until after 7:30pm, after watching all but the final minutes of the Seahawks beating of the Eagles. We stopped at the theater to pick up our tickets at will-call and to ask when they expect The National to go on -- 10pm, so we had plenty of time.

We went to Hudson Public Ale House, a place I've wanted to go to for years now just because of the name (that they have a good beer list is a coincidence, I'm sure). It was close enough to the U District and probably the closest we'd be to the place for a while, so we went.
<!--more-->We both got the same thing: a burger with an egg on top, a relatively new treat for us. They had good beers on the beer list, most of which we'd not had or even heard of, which is rare for us. I couldn't resist Maritime's Jolly Roger, being Christmas-y time of year and one of my favorite Christmas beers that is not often found on tap. Gay got Sound Brewing's <a href="http://www.soundbrewery.com/beers.php#">Humulo Nimbus, Double IPA</a>. After dinner, we still had time so we shared the <a href="http://oakbrew.com/2010/10/14/ill-tempered-gnome/">Oakshire Ill-Tempered Gnome</a>, another winter seasonal, before we left for the show.

I discovered The National randomly searching for something else and immediately loved the 2007 album <em>Boxer</em>. I'll always remember that album as my and Havana's first band we shared... when I was left to take care of her when she was just a couple months old, I had the hardest time getting her to calm down when she was crying, partly because she wanted mommy and because I had no idea what I was doing. But I found that she always stopped crying and listened when she heard the opening piano in their song "Fake Empire". It quickly became my trick and I would rock her in my arms listening to the album, as if I was dancing with her. Those songs still bring back those memories for me.

We got home just before midnight and, after letting the nanny go, immediately went to bed.]]></content:encoded>
