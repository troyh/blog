		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img style="float:left;" src="http://static.flickr.com/32/88715108_d1a8443323_m.jpg" />We sold the Grand Cherokee on eBay on Thursday to a Marine stationed in Okinawa, Japan. That's something that would've been impossible just a few years ago! He lives in the Seattle area and hopes to come back in July. His parents came to complete the transaction yesterday, somewhat concerned that their son bought a car on the internet.

It is and was a great car. Gay and I started dating shortly after I helped her find the car in 1998 -- she wanted a Nissan Pathfinder and I wisely talked her into a Grand Cherokee (I also owned one a the time). We took it to California that summer to tour Napa Valley, to San Francisco and camping in the Redwood Forest. I dented the side when I was teaching Gay how (not) to parallel park.Oh the memories.I hated to see it go. But we now have a Jeep Commander that Gay talked me into this time.

I still have my beautiful 1985 BMW 535i -- not a 528, a 535! -- relaxing in the garage. One day I may even drive it again.]]></content:encoded>
