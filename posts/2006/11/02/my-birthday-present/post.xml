		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Gay got me a <a href="http://www.fullers-ales.com/esb.php">Fuller's ESB</a> tap handle from eBay. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. I bet there's not more than 100 people in the US who have one of these at home. If only the beer that came out of the tap was Fuller's. :)

For those of you who haven't heard me rattle on about how perfect this beer is, it's my favorite beer, the beer I'd choose if I could only have one beer the rest of my life. And I was fortunate enough to have a keg of it served at our wedding. I even convinced a Vashon restaurant to serve it when they first opened (but they've since stopped since I didn't drink enough of it to justify the cost, apparently).

Please forgive me for commenting here; I couldn't find an email link anywhere.

I was really saddened to see your negative review of my book Everyware on Amazon, and I'm sorry to hear that you didn't think the book was of much interest.

I'm particularly sorry that you found it repetitive, as I went to a fair amount of trouble to craft a narrative that develops over the course of the book. I'd surely appreciate it if you'd take the time to send me a quick note going into a little more detail as to which aspects you found less than satisfactory.

Happy birthday, by the way.

All best,
ag
