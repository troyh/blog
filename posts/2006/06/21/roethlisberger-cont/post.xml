		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ben was appropriately contrite after <a href="http://troyandgay.com/?p=3190">his idiotic accident</a>:
<blockquote>"I recognize that I have a responsibility to safeguard my health in the off-season so I can continue to lead our team effectively. I never meant any harm to others nor to break any laws. I was confident in my ability to ride a motorcycle and simply believed such an accident would not happen to me.

"If I ever ride again, it certainly will be with a helmet."</blockquote>
He didn't intend to break any laws, yeah, I guess, although the law was pretty clear that he was not licensed to ride without a helmet. <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06171/699570-66.stm">Cowher had wise words</a> on Ben's stupidity:
<blockquote>"Sometimes with the lessons of life, you have to get knocked down before you get back up," he said.</blockquote>
But I won't be eating any <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/138858">Roethlis-burgers</a> until I'm sure he's ready to win another Super Bowl.]]></content:encoded>
