If he hasn't even read the 10 Commandments, can we believe he's read the bill he is trying to push through Congress?

Congress just <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003059851_watch14.html">secretly voted</a> to give themselves another pay-raise, something they've done ever year for 7 years, while <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101069.html?nav=rss_politics">voting against a minimum-wage increase</a>, something they've done every year for 9 years. If we're paying their salaries, is it too much to ask that they actually spend some time reading the things they endorse?

Argh! I hate politics. Why do I even bother to find something positiveÂ  in the political news?]]></content:encoded>
