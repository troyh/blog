		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Congratulations to Floyd. I didn't think he'd do it at the beginning, and was sure he wouldn't after he lost 8 minutes in the Alps. But his comeback was one of the great moments in sports. And to think, just when the French finally get rid of an American winning the Tour every year, another one comes along and wins it. That's what they get for bashing Lance and really bashing Floyd this year.
I really thought Hincapie would do well this year, but he was over an hour behind Landis. Leipheimer didn't do much better. The other Americans weren't even relevant. Now Floyd goes for hip-replacement surgery, but I won't say that he won't win it next year....]]></content:encoded>
