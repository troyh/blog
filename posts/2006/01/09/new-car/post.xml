		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're finally replacing our 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee with a 2006 Jeep Commander. It's stupid to buy a new car, but we couldn't resist or wait another year for a used one because we liked the Commander so much. It's one of those cars you either love or hate; we love the boxy old-style Jeep look.

We picked it up last week after ordering it back in November. So far, we <em>love</em> it. It's amazing how far the car industry has come in the last decade in general comfort, road noise, and gadgetry. Jeep fixed every annoyance I had with the Grand Cherokee and added stuff that I wished the Grand Cherokee had. Unfortunately, it gets worse gas mileage than the Grand Cherokee, but we only drive 6,000 miles/year so we shouldn't notice it much.]]></content:encoded>
