After the Seahawks and their fans pathetic whining about officiating, some (including Holmgren himself) accusing the refs of being paid off (!), they need to change "The 12th Man" to "The 12th Baby". It wasn't a ref that missed two field goals, that dropped four passes, that let Willie Parker run 75 yards for a touchdown and a Super Bowl record, that was completely fooled by a 43-yard reverse TD pass they admit to have been expecting, that couldn't manage the clock at the end of the first half, that threw an interception at the 10-yard line, that let their QB get sacked twice at crucial times, etc.]]></content:encoded>
