		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back when I was at Microsoft, one of my projects was to add integration of NetMeeting (Microsoft's online videoconferencing product) into Outlook. In 1998, if I recall correctly, <a href="http://mbookspan.spaces.live.com/">Matthew Bookspan</a> wrote a patent filing for this feature and added my name to it. All I did was review the thing, if that. And lo and behold, <a href="http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=pat&amp;qt=pat&amp;reel=&amp;frame=&amp;pat=6363352&amp;pub=&amp;asnr=&amp;asnri=&amp;asne=&amp;asnei=&amp;asns=">the patent</a> was granted in 2002.

Frankly, though, it's a patent that shouldn't have been granted. I didn't think it had a chance at the time, since we didn't do anything that wasn't terribly obvious. Now I'm part of <a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/patents.html">the software patent problem</a>.]]></content:encoded>
