Much better than the "Red Herring article":http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2789 and the Seattle Times understands that you _link_ to web site you are talking about in an online article. The photo was taken at our colocation facility in downtown Seattle -- the machines behind us are the servers that run the site.
