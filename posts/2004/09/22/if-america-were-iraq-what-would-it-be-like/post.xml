The population of the US is over 11 times that of Iraq, so a lot of statistics would have to be multiplied by that number.

Thus, violence killed 300 Iraqis last week, the equivalent proportionately of 3,300 Americans. What if 3,300 Americans had died in car bombings, grenade and rocket attacks, machine gun spray, and aerial bombardment in the last week? That is a number greater than the deaths on September 11, and if America were Iraq, it would be an ongoing, weekly or monthly toll.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That really brings things home... and then people wonder why you get protests in the form of kidnapping and beheading. I'm not saying it's right, but if America were Iraq I wonder what extreme means some Americans on the fringe might feel driven to. I think what we are seeing in Iraq is the result of putting people under incredible ongoing stress and what they feel they have to do to change things "for the better", even if their way of enforcing change is abhorrent to us.]]></wp:comment_content>
