One of my favorite things about my iBook is the latch to close it. It's magnetic, so when I close it the magnet pulls the latch out so it can lock closed. On PC laptops, the latch is always sticking out, just waiting to get broken off. A 1Â¢ magnet makes my iBook better. Another great iBook design is the light on the plug: it's orange when charging and green when charged. Not only is this more logical than PC laptops typical design (on when charging, off when charged; or one light on when charging, another one when charged), but its location is more logical than simply throwing an LED on the side of the laptop the way PCs do.

It really is the little things that make you love products.]]></content:encoded>
