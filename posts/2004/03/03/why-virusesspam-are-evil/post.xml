<blockquote><i>Dear user of Recipezaar.com,

contain viruses,  in order  to  keep your computer and e-mail account  safe,
please, follow  the  instructions.

<blockquote><i>Dear  user of  Recipezaar.com,

Some of  our clients complained  about  the spam  (negative e-mail content)
outgoing from your e-mail account. Probably, you have been infected by

Now, of course, I know this didn't happen, because, well Troy/I = Recipezaar, but imagine someone at Earthlink or AOL or some random ISP getting the same message...]]></content:encoded>
