		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We got home from our mini-vacation in Vancouver yesterday. Ate lots of good food while we were there, including <a href="http://www.evevancouver.ca/food/kitsilano.htm#Maria's">the best Greek food</a> I've had in 8 years. Seattle is terrible for Greek food and it's one thing I really miss from Washington, DC.

One thing that surprised me about Vancouver is the beer selection. Most restaurants have local beers, but none were that good. I ended up just having Stella Artois (Belgian beer in British Columbia; why not British beer?!) most of the time. Although we went to a couple brewpubs for good beer, <a href="http://www.steamworks.com/">Steamworks</a> had the best beer and good pizza (but terrible terrible service at lunch time).]]></content:encoded>
