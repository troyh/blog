		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The ARIA, the Australian equivalent of the RIAA, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/18/1079199330947.html">reports</a> that music sales are up to an all-time high, profits are up and prices are down. The industry is prospering and consumers are paying less. Who's the loser in the file-sharing era? CD single sales are down, which is good, because those things are a rip-off anyway and singles (really just advertisements) should be downloaded for free.

Speaking of this, I bought 3 Pepsis yesterday since the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/pepsi/">iTunes giveaway</a> promises 1 in 3 will win. I opened the first one and I'm a winner! And it seems that Pepsi fixed the <a href="http://www.macmerc.com/news/archives/1270">cheat</a>, because I couldn't tell in the store which ones were winners.]]></content:encoded>
