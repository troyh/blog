The spaces for the windows are surprisingly big, it was shocking to walk into the room for the first time.

Tomorrow the windows should go in and the electrician is coming on Monday to do all the electrical work. We still need to pick out the flooring. Right now, we're planning to go with a dark brown bamboo flooring. Bamboo is extremely durable and eco-friendly since bamboo is essentially a weed, so there's no shortage of it.]]></content:encoded>
