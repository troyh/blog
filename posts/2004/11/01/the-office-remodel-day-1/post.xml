		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our office remodel has begun today. "Ron":http://www.mitchellcontractors.com/ woke us up at 8am on the button with his crew to start the demolition. The wall that divided the office is coming out to create one large room instead of two small rooms. And the small windows are being replaced with two much larger windows. The electrician also came today to scope out the electrical work, which will give us lots more electrical outlets and a bunch of ethernet taps, so we can have less cablign running around the room. Hopefully, it'll all be done in three weeks.

The wall broken down to the studs:

The wall completely gone and the drywall taken off the outside wall:
