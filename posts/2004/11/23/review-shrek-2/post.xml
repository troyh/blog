The story just wasn't as entertaining. The cultural references weren't that striking, as many reviews said. Yeah, it was cute that the fast food place was named "Fryar's" and Far Far Away Land was obviously Los Angeles.

We watched the extras on the DVD and about how much more advanced technically than the first one, but you know what? I didn't even notice. I wasn't amazed that the characters got stuck in a rain shower and got drenched, something "never before done" in a computer-animated movie. All I remember about that scene was thinking "what was the purpose of that rain shower?"

It was entertaining and funny and worth watching, but I really liked the first movie and this one didn't do it for me as much.]]></content:encoded>
