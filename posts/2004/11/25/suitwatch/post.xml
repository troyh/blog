Second, why has nobody ever whined about the "threat" of physical commodities, such as those that give us food and shelter, that we can't live without?"</p>

The rest of it is a good read. And I like his construction industry analogy to software. When asked about my old of Program Manager at Microsoft, I always said a PM was like the architect (they don't actually do the work, they just think about it) and I haven't heard a better description yet. :)]]></content:encoded>
