		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We run a <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com">recipe web site</a> which means our busiest time of year is during the run up to the big holidays, so our celebrations are always delayed now.  I have to admit, I'm beginning to like it.  We're going to our friends' John &amp; Deborah's on Thursday, so we get to have dinner without getting stressed about making it to the grocery store tomorrow.  We're having other friends out here for turkey on Saturday night.  We can cook while the rest of the world Christmas shops.  I've only <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/mycookbook/book/30270/">started collecting recipes to choose from for a menu today</a>.  Thanksgiving is still my favorite holiday, and I am really looking forward to sharing it with our close friends, even if a few days late.]]></content:encoded>
