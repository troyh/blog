We finally got the digital versions of our photos from our wedding. This is us with my family. Left to right, my sister, my mom, me, my dad, Gay, my brother and my sister-in-law.

Funny story about the chairs in the picture.... we <a href="http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=1951">bought a set of four leather chairs</a> when we visited New York City in 2002. They were all different chairs but the delivery company screwed up and delivered one chair twice, hence the two duplicate chairs shown here. :)

If anyone who attended wants photos, email us and let us know. There's tons of photos so there's probably one of you.]]></content:encoded>
