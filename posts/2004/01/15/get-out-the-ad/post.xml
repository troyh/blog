		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> (an organization founded by average folks in response to frustration with Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings, the lack of congressional resolution, and a desire to get the country focused on real problems) sponsored an amateur video contest:  Make a thirty second spot that best explains what the president's policies are really all about, not just those lame voice over commercials you usually see in political campaigns.  It is a brilliant idea, and the <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/index.html">Bush in 30 seconds</a> winner is great.  They are now raising money to get the spot played on CNN during the State of the Union address coverage and during the Superbowl -- though so far <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/sports/2357653">CBS says the ad doesn't pass their Standards and Practices committee</a>, huh?!  They allow White House ads, ads against smoking, other political ads.  PLEASE!

I believe this kind of free political expression is precisely what our country is founded on.  <a href="http://www.moveonvoterfund.org/donate/creditcard.html">We gave to the cause, and encourage you to do so too</a>, if you believe in freedom of speech and would like to see a political ad truly made by the people instead of boring ads made by big dumb political action committees or parties.]]></content:encoded>
