		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After 35 hours, our power was finally restored at 10:15am this morning. Why is electricity so poorly-maintained? Because it's a monopoly. Monopolies have no incentive to improve their service, in fact, they are incented to not improve it because improving it costs money that cannot be recouped. And of course, since it's a monopoly, we have no choice but to continue paying any fees they want to charge us regardless of the quality of the service.

AT&amp;T had a federally-granted monopoly on telephone service in the US for many years but the government finally broke it up (thanks to lawyers on behalf of MCI). We need lawyers to sue to break up power companies and create competition in this critical industry. The service will be more reliable and costs will be lower.]]></content:encoded>
