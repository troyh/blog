		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="tinyj.gif">Did you know that the term "spinster":http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=spinster is derived from the fact that women who didn't marry supported themselves through "spinning", or weaving? And, surprisingly, there's only one "Spinner's Guild":http://www.textilelinks.com/guild/ri.html in all of Rhode Island. I wonder  how many spinners there are in Rhode Island. I know of at least one, but she's unhappy because she has to spin all by herself.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Let's just end this at this.... You don't like Gay or me. We don't like you. Perfect, we're finally in agreement.

So let's make a deal: all of you agree to stop posting (or wanting to post) in the forums on Recipezaar and Gay &amp; I will stop giving timeouts to rest of the Brats (assuming they behave). You can continue to make your silly little jokes on your mailing list and, assuming none of the comments are leaked to us again, we'll forget all of you even exist. (Even the pathetic small penis jokes; and BTW, I'm 5'11", so the short-person jokes go nowhere too)

Agree?]]></wp:comment_content>

You know what you have done is wrong and far beyond anything the "Brats" have ever done that may have been considered to be offensive on Zaar. What's with the 976 comment? What has gotten into you? Has somebody publicly humiliated you or Gay? Where is this coming from? I want my recipes off your site. Recipezaar is not what I thought it was. And YOUR are not who I thought you were. Besides the fact that I met some really cool new people, I regret ever getting involved in that site.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Troy, please relax and think about what sort of values you were attempting to promote at the beginning of this ordeal when it started on Zaar. I think if you looked at things in that light you would see that this is wrong. I supported your right to make the choices of who is welcome at Zaar. It is your site and you are correct, you can make it the type of site you want it to be. This does not mean that I thought the decision to ban people the way it happened and for the reasons it happened was the right thing to do, just that you had a right to do it. I expressed to a few of the brats that I was sad to see them go and hoped for thier return when they were able and I am not part of the Brats. There are people out here that have no side in this debate but are indeed shocked at what is happening here. Please just think about the ideals you were promoting and then think   if this thread on your blog is consistant with those ideals. Please don't take this as a personal attack agianst you because I am talking to you and not the others. I just really thought these kinds of things were beneath you.]]></wp:comment_content>

As with the Kari incident, don't assume you know the whole truth until the whole truth is made public. :)  And if you think the Kari evidence was compelling, wait til you see this evidence.

And the posts aren't deleted, they are "unapproved". I will be happy to send them to you later, after this is resolved.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ok, so we've heard from Allie Pie, Jane and Bethany that they do not want to be on Recipezaar's forums. Can we get agreement from the rest?

DigitalAether, as you might imagine, this post was so intentionally vague so only the Brats would "get it". And they got the point, I think. They repeatedly made members of Recipezaar feel bad and they defended their actions as "just jokes". This was "just a joke" intended to point out that feelings can be hurt. And, as I said during the Kari incident, we will aggressively and vigorously defend ourselves against people intending to harm the site and members of the site.

As long as we're talking about lawyers, let's discuss the threats/encouragement for the Brats to vandalize our house. What would a criminal attorney think of that?  The threat or conspiracy to commit a crime is a crime as well.

Again, please let's try to resolve the issue between the Brats and Recipezaar. More posts that avoid the issue will be hidden. If you don't want to participate in the Recipezaar forums, let us know here. If you prefer, you can send me mail at troy at recipezaar dot com.

Jane, your photo was posted on a public web site, not Recipezaar. And the picture was so obfuscated, that only you or your close friends would recognize it. You know that, so please stop harping on a pointless issue.]]></wp:comment_content>
