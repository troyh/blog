		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night, we went to the "charity auction":http://www.vashonisland.net/rotary/ that we "helped out initially":http://troyandgay.com/index.php?p=2625 on. It was held at "Misty Isle Farms":http://www.mistyislefarms.com/, the home of Tom Stewart, a local Vashon celebrity. That alone was a treat for us, never having been there. He lives on beautiful grounds, immaculately landscaped complete with a waterfall and a rose garden.

It was raining like crazy (Seattle has had an unusually wet summer) and it was outside, but it was covered by a huge tent. The food was prepared by the same people who did our wedding Rehearsal Dinner a few weeks ago, so that was good. The event was a wine festival so there was plenty of wine and cheese to taste, and that we did.

Most of the auction items were expensive bottles of wine and we were outbid on a few bottles of wine by people at our own table, apparently wine connoisseurs. But we did end up with a bottle of 1984 "Stags Leap":http://www.stagsleapwinery.com/ Cabernet Sauvignon. I think we overpaid, but hey, it's for charity. :)  Gay also bought three of the table centerpieces, large glass vases.

After the auction, we went to our friends' house for some (more) wine, to play with their new puppy and we watched "Fargo":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/. Great movie.]]></content:encoded>
