"Do not touch the blue 'E!' " the note says.</i>

IE has 94% marketshare still according to WebSideStory, but on Recipezaar, it's already down to 80% and seems to be steadily dropping. From what we can tell, the #1 reason people stick with IE is because "it's what I know". Other reasons are to keep the Google toolbar because of its popup-blocking feature and the resistance to downloading another browser. But those that switched sure seem to love their new browser (Firefox mostly it seems).]]></content:encoded>
