Making any wedding-type decision for a man is far more painful than for a woman. ;) But that aside, I highly recommend eloping if you're thinking of planning a wedding. Weddings are a scam.... try it yourself, call a photographer to take some photos and they'll charge $100/hr. Mention "wedding" and the price is suddenly $500/hr, if not more. Same for everything else. My advice: set your budget, halve, and halve it again. You'll end up paying your original budget in the end.

But I do have my jobs... aside from my suit, I have to get the beer (!) and handle the music setup. We're not doing a band, we're doing music streamed from our laptops. Which also means I've been selecting the music. I don't know what I'd do without the internet; I don't want to buy Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, any 80's one-hit wonder CDs, or any stuff my parents like (Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, etc.) because I just want a song or two. Thanks to P2P, I've got a nice set of wedding music.  And I don't know how I'd do this without a computer; just 5 years ago and I'd have to hire a DJ to swap CDs all night. But now I can just set up playlists that mix nicely all by itself, and if our friends want to, they can do their own DJing at our wedding. Technology!]]></content:encoded>
