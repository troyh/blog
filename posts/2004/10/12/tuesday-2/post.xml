It's so humid here that you can only sit outside, even in the shade, for 30 minutes before you have to get in the pool to cool off. So that's what we did all morning and afternoon: alternate between the chaise lounge and the pool. This was the most relaxing day we've had for over a week. And Gay's even learning to swim!

In the afternoon, we decided to go for a walk on the beach. But I made the mistake of wearing a long-sleeve and heavy linen shirt. It was fine on the breezy beach, but when we walked into the town of Legian, the lack of a breeze and shade was too much and the hour-long walk through town ended in me being drenched in sweat. So we returned to the hotel to get back in the pool.

For dinner, we went to the hotel's restaurant and to see the Indonesian dancing on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The buffet-style dinner was nice (barbecued beef, lamb and chorizo; salads; soup; lots of desserts). And the hotel has spotlights on the surf so you could see the white of the waves breaking even after sunset, which is a nice effect that I've never seen a beach hotel do.

By this time, it was _way_ past our bedtime (9:30!), so we came back tired and went to bed.]]></content:encoded>
