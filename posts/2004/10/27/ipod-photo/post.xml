		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love my iPod. I love my Mac. I love Apple. I love my digital camera. I love technology. And Steve Jobs is 100% right that video on the iPod is a dumb idea. But I've been trying to figure out why I would want the "iPod Photo":http://apple.com/ipodphoto. I can't download my photos from my camera straight to the iPod Photo, so it's not a replacement for a laptop on vacation (even if I didn't want my laptop on vacation). Never in my life have I ever (or even wanted to) go to a friend's house to show them my photos on their TV -- I believe the only person who wants to see the majority of my photos is me. I already have TiVo that does the slideshows on my own TV, even if I were inclined to move the dock from my desktop to my TV or go find the cable to plug into the TV. And I really don't understand why someone would want to carry 25,000 photos around.

But I'm sure the iPod Photo will sell like crazy. What are people going to really do with it?]]></content:encoded>
