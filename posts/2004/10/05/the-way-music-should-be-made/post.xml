"Nonesuch is piracy-proof,'' the singer Emmylou Harris -- who became the label's first ''adult pop'' signing four years ago -- said when I asked her to list the things that set her label apart. ''Their audience actually enjoys buying a record. When I got into music in my teens, the album was a thing in itself. It was a whole piece of work that had a reason to flow the way it did. You weren't interested in just one or two songs. Nonesuch is still in the business of supporting album artists.'']]></content:encoded>
