			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's a <a href="http://summerlovestory.com/wrong/gay_marriage_bush.html" rel="nofollow"> big victory for gays and lesbians</a> that Bush says he's not opposed to state-by-state recognition of civil unions for gay and lesbian couples. Sure, no new rights were conferred by Bush's mere statement, but Bush's statement marks a tidal wave of progress for gay and lesbian Americans.

It is important that Bush mentioned rights in his statement. This frames the issue of civil marriage for gays and lesbians as about individual rights. Bush and others have been framing the issue as about protecting children and traditional values - which is not only more difficult to challenge but is also very dangerous for gays and lesbians. Turning gays and lesbians into threats against children and society is a <a href="http://summerlovestory.com/wrong/gay_marriage.html" rel="nofollow"> low form of propaganda.</a>

Bush has taken a stand that puts the redefinition of marriage "rights" front center in this debate.  We should use this as a reframing opportunity that will help extend civil marriage rights to gays and lesbians under the full and equal protection of the law.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[One thing that liberals need to learn from neo-conservatives is <a href="http://summerlovestory.com/frames/gay_marriage.html" rel="nofollow">how to better frame issues</a> in terms favorable to the desired outcome. A good example is how anti-gay rights advocates have seized the movement for extending civil marriage rights as a way to bolster the religious political base and to oppose civil rights for gays and lesbians. They use message discipline along with discourse framing to get their message across - regardless of how their views are reported.]]></wp:comment_content>
