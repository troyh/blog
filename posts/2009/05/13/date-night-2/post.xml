		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We picked up our repaired Mac Pro at the Apple Store (I love AppleCare!) and then went out to dinner tonight in Seattle. The food was disappointing and we had to listen the waiter tell us that he doesn't believe in global warming and that he's sick of the Spanish-speaking people in California.

After dinner and on the way home, we stopped at my favorite pub, Beveridge Place, for a beer so that I could attend one event during <a href="http://www.seattlebeerweek.com/">Seattle Beer Week</a>. There was a beer geek trivia contest going on that we played, but we did terrible. I thought I was a beer geek, but those questions were hard!]]></content:encoded>
