We've had her for over 10 years now. Her vital stats are all still good but she has arthritis so she has trouble getting up and down the stairs (unless food is involved) and getting up from laying down. In spite of that, she still comes up the stairs and down the stairs to the office every morning to spend the morning with us. And when the kids have lunch, she somehow knows about it and she climbs the stairs again to get down for any food that Hudson may drop on the floor. And then she comes back up to the office.]]></content:encoded>
