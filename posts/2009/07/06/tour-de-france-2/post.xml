		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Tour is already exciting. It's usually boring the first week but today Lance Armstrong got into a breakaway just 30km before the finish and gained 40 seconds on the other big contenders for the victory, including his teammate and favored winner, Alberto Contador. He's ahead of him by 19 seconds.

Tomorrow is the team time trial which their team, Astana, is expected to win. If they do and beat team Saxo-Bank by 40+ seconds Lance will be in yellow tomorrow. And the tensions between him and Contador should be interesting.]]></content:encoded>
