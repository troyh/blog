		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A slowly-growing trend in craft beer is to package it in cans. 21st Amendment, which <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/03/17/21st-amendment-brewpub-review/">we visited</a> in 2008, is one of the few that does this now and we can finally get their beers locally so Gay picked some up recently. I look forward to getting more craft beer in a can -- easier to carry, less prone to breakage, better protection from light and air and more eco-friendly.

This <em>Brew Free! or Die IPA</em> is delicious. We also got their <em>H</em><em>ell or High Watermelon Wheat</em>, which I'd heard good things about in spite of it being a wheat beer, but I didn't like it at all.]]></content:encoded>
