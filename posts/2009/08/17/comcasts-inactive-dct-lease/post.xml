		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got the latest Comcast bill notification email and looked at my bill and discovered a charge for $13.40 under Comcast Cable Television:

The funny thing is that we don't have Comcast Cable TV. We used to years ago, so I assume that "Inactive DCT Lease" means that we're being charged for the inactive Digital Cable TV set-top box leases that we used to have (we only had 2, not 4, though). I contacted their customer service and they credited us for the charge and for the charges back to June when they started charging us for this. In June and July they only charged us for one lease. Either someone screwed up in the billing department and this happened to lots of people (likely since the customer service rep seemed not surprised by this and quickly fixed it) or Comcast is evil. I am assuming the former... for now.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You're right: Comcast IS evil. Same thing JUST happened to me just after I did the mandatory conversion to digital cable boxes. Comcast started billing me this for 2 boxes at $3.20 each. When I phoned them they SUPER quickly apologized and, also removed the $40 service charge for them to come out and fix THEIR cable, and cut my monthly rate for a year.  I suspect "Inactive DCT lease" is fraud and reported this to my local TV news investigative team.  I wonder how many people's accounts are "set up incorrectly"  Ha!   Thanks for your posting.]]></wp:comment_content>
