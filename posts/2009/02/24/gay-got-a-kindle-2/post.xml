I wish this was the Version 1.0 model, mine looks like a device from the 1970s compared to Kindle 2. They fixed the most annoying things that Kindle 1 had, improved the screen and made it much thinner and more comfortable to hold.

We can even share books that we each buy between our Kindles. Hopefully we can stop collecting piles of books around the house and stop buying and building bookshelves!]]></content:encoded>
