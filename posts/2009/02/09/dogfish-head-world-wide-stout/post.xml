		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I finally had my first World Wide Stout. This beer is unbelievable. The label reads "A very dark beer brewed with a ridiculous amount of barley". It takes six months to age too. It's an 18% ABV beer, which makes it 30% more alcohol than wine and even more potent than the 14% "Raison D'Extra":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/24/dogfish-head-raison-dextra/, but less than their "120 Minute IPA":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/06/08/dogfish-head-120-minute-ipa/. So one bottle is like drinking 3 glasses of wine. It's almost irresponsible to call this a beer. Plus, it tastes more like a port than a beer. I shared it with Gay and we drank it out of wine glasses. It took me an hour to drink my half!

I haven't had a beer like this since Sam Adams Triple Bock back in early 1990s. It's a great beer for sipping, and I loved every sip of it.

I'm either in love with Dogfish Head or they put something else in the beer... last night I dreamt that I visited the Dogfish Head brewery.]]></content:encoded>
