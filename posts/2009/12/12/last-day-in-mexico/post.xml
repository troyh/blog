Our place was next to the resort but we're not supposed to be in the resort and we eventually were chased out by the security guard. I don't know why, nobody was there so we weren't bothering anyone. Security guards tend to take their jobs too seriously. After the kids went to bed, we had a dinner by ourselves for a change.

I've had enough of the heat and sun. I'm ready to get back to Seattle, which has been in the 30s all week and to get ready for Christmas.]]></content:encoded>
