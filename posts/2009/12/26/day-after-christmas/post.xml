		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Steve and Renuka, sans kids, and Eric came over for a Christmas dinner. Eric just returned from his trip around the world that <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/27/erics-around-the-world-trip/">he started in August 2008</a> and we last saw him, as a surprise, <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/21/eric-in-london/">in London earlier this year</a>. He came back the US a few days before Christmas and is staying at his parents in Bellingham. He came down for dinner with us and spent the night.

Dinner was great, as Gay's dinner always are, and Steve and I drank too much and both had hangovers the next day.]]></content:encoded>
