		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We left Sunday morning for a long drive up to Ashland, Oregon. I was expecting to arrive in Ashland, eat dinner at a Subway or something and go to bed early in a lousy hotel. The lousy hotel was right, but we discovered that Ashland has a nice little brewpub, "The Standing Stone Brewing Co":http://www.standingstonebrewing.com/. This was a nice place to go after a long day of driving, but Hudson was very tired and cranky, which is unusual for him. That made dinner less fun. Of the sample set of beers, we both liked the Belgian Saison and I liked the Double IPA.
