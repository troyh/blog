We just had a bottle of wine and some cheese and olives for a light dinner. The bottle of wine was a 1994 <a href="http://plumpjack.com/winery1.html">Plumpjack</a> Cabernet Sauvignon that we bought for about $35 in 1998 at the winery on a camping trip through Napa Valley when we first started dating (Gay calls that our most romantic date ever). That bottle is now <a href="http://www.parkaveliquor.com/shop.asp?st=Plumpjack">worth $185</a>!

Had we sold it instead of drinking it, it would have been a 529% return on our investment. That's a 75% gain each year for 7 years. It tasted great, by the way (but not $185 good, IMO). I wish we had bought two.]]></content:encoded>
