We ate and cooked a lot (and took over 100 photos to prove it!). We planned to watch <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1808405432">The Incredibles</a>, but we only got the Extras DVD, so we watched <a href="http://www.miramax.com/quietamerican/">The Quiet American</a>, which was good, even though we all fell asleep at one point or another during it (although that was probably caused more by the wine than the movie).

On Saturday, after returning from the airport, we dropped the movies off at Blockbuster and they gave us the correct DVD for The Incredibles. We watched it that night and loved it! It may be my favorite <a href="http://pixar.com">Pixar</a> movie yet.

I spent the rainy weekend doing a lot of miscellaneous work that I've needed to do while Gay, who was running around for weeks without rest, relaxed and went for a 19-mile run Sunday morning.]]></content:encoded>

Seriously, The Incredibles is one of the best family movies I've seen in awhile. I hate to keep saying(because I seem to say it almost everytime I see a new animated movie), but I'm am so amazed every time I watch something computer animated. I remember being flaberghasted at the swimming scenes. The water was so realistic.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Troy and Gay- How strange!!!! My husband and I started Sunday off with
watching the Quiet American. Then, an hour later, we watched The Incredibles!
It's as if we are twins! LOL. Of course, it helped that it was cold and damp
outside for us to decide to indulge in so much movie watching.

I enjoyed the Incredibles so much- it was the most realistic family portrayed
in animation, but the most unrealistic visually.

I don't usually write, but to have us mimicking each other in movie watching
was something I had to comment on.]]></wp:comment_content>
