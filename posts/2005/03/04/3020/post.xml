We, on behalf of Recipezaar, just donated to our favorite radio station, <a href="http://kexp.org">KEXP</a>. It's a public-supported radio station and its what we listen to all day while we sit at our computers every day, we've found out about the majority of the music we listen to these days, so we figure we owe them something. And I can't help but want to support non-corporate music. :)

Yikes, if I knew they'd read the email I sent <em>verbatim</em> I'd have written something more clever or interesting. It probably sounds dumb out of context, but if you heard the entire show they were getting punch drunk after being up for hours during their pledge drive -- they're normally less giggly. <a href="/pix/kexp.wav">Listen to the clip</a>.]]></content:encoded>
