This is a smart move for both, I bet Groove was dying and Gates always had a crush on Ray Ozzie (once <a href="http://www.crn.com/sections/special/hof/hof.jhtml;jsessionid=FN5OXFII4GJIYQSNDBGCKHSCJUMEKJVN?articleId=18832816&amp;_requestid=409857">calling him "the greatest programmer in the universe"</a>).

But what this really means is that Microsoft is too bureaucratic to get much done. There must've been at least three groups working on what Groove has built. I know Office has been working on exactly that for almost a decade, Exchange always wanted to do it, MSN is surely trying to do the instant-messaging audio/video aspect, and I'm sure there's several people in Research working on the problem too.

So why couldn't Microsoft ship it themselves and have to buy a company that could? Because Microsoft is not a software company, it's a company that sells software.]]></content:encoded>
