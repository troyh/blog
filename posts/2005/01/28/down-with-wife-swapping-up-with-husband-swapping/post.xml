Troy thought a wife-swapping (I say "husband-swapping") movie was in poor taste so soon after our own wedding, but the movie less about swinging,  than the emptiness in certain truth-telling in relationships, not just Bob &amp; Carol's but also Carol &amp; Alice's....  The most hilarious scene is the one with Ted &amp; Alice in the bedroom trying to negotiate sex.  It would be difficult to put my finger on another movie that highlighted more clearly the difference between men and women.]]></content:encoded>
