		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We went to <a href="http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/41542429/seattle_wa/crow.html?cslink=roundup_name_noncust&amp;ulink=roundup__roundupentity1-3_1__0_profile_2_1">Crow</a> last night for dinner after visiting <a href="http://www.internap.com/">Internap</a>'s Open House at the <a href="http://www.fisherplaza.com/">Fisher Plaza</a>. They have a very impressive facility.</p>

The food at Crow was good but the wait staff was a bit on the surly side. Because we were late for our reservation, we had to sit at the food bar, which is pretty nice as you get to watch the chefs prepare your food. I had a braised duck and Gay had the lamb shank. Both were excellent. And the prices are moderate.]]></content:encoded>
