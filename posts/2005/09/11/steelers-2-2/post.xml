It started out badly, the Titans easily marched down the field on the first possession for a touchdown. I started getting bad feelings about the season. A rookie running back replacing the veterans Staley and Bettis, a second-year quarterback that finished last year poorly, a great receiver traded. But the Steelers scored on their first possession and didn't stop scoring when they got the ball til the 4th quarter. The Titans didn't punt either til the 4th quarter, but that's just because they kept turning the ball over. Their offense was worthless. And this rookie running back, Willie Parker, had a great first game of his career.]]></content:encoded>
