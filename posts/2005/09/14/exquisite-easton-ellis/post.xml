I won the book because <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/eastonellis/game.php">my team, The Tardy Terbys, wrote the winning story</a> in an online game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse">Exquisite Corpse</a>, a surrealist, literary game of telephone, where each person only sees the last sentence written in a collaborative story.

The game is perfectly suited for online play, and the design company the built the software did a good job.  You sign up and are placed on a team.  You get email letting you know when it is your turn to play with a link to a website that displays only the last sentence contributed with a field to add yours.  We wrote the story very quickly, and from the sentences I saw there were some talented and imaginative writers in our random group.  I can't really see how the game helps market the book at all, but it was one of the more creative online tie-in games I've ever seen.

If other Tardy Terbys find this, please sign in.  It is so fun to have won something as a team of strangers.]]></content:encoded>

It sounds like something I (and a friend of mine) would really enjoy!
(even if we *don't* win anything!)

thanks,
