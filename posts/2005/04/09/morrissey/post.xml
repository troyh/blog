I just got <a href="http://morrisseymusic.com">Morrissey</a>'s <em>Who Put the 'M' in Manchester?</em> DVD. I'm a huge Morrissey fan... I realized how much recently. I loved The Smiths, of course, but if I were to name my ten favorite artists, I doubt Morrissey would appear on it. Yet every new CD he comes out with I buy and I like them. I don't even have all The Smiths CDs but I have every Morrissey solo CD. And it wasn't intentional, so I must really like his music. (I wonder what else I like ;) )

But the highlight of the DVD for me is a Smiths song, <em>There is a Light That Never Goes Out</em>. I haven't listened to <em>The Queen Is Dead</em> in years so  had forgotten how great this song is. The crowd singing the morbidly romantic chorus is what does it:

<blockquote>And if a double-decker bus
crashes into us,
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die.

And if a 10-ton truck
kills the both of us,
To die by your side,
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine.
</blockquote>

His latest CD, <em>You Are The Quarry</em>, is one of his best yet, so it's great to see him continue to do well in his career.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't understand the fascination with Morrissey (not just with you, but everyone that buys his albums). He's always so dreary.
I'll admit that I bought the Smiths "Meat is Murder" just for the unlisted "How Soon is Now" cut back in the day when music was only available on vinyl. I usually refrain from buying singles because I like to see what else a particular artist is all about. I liked HSIN, but I found the rest of the album, well, "complain-y".
I typically enjoy dark--but usually high-energy--music, and even admittedly some depressing music once in a while. But it strikes me that Morrissey is playing this despair motif up to the hilt, not to mention profit. Nobody could be as depressed and rejected as Morrissey for so long and not commit suicide. Could it be that he, along with similar artists, have found their money-making niche?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I never thought of the The Smiths as dreary at all. The Cure in their early years, yes, but not The Smiths. I think the music is pretty energetic (and very original). The lyrics were that 80s "teen angst" thing, but then again, they were the one of the ones who created that. :)

Morrissey just has a way of making catchy songs. And a way of writing funny/odd lyrics that make sense. He's an artist, artists express themselves through their art. I'm sure Morrissey is happy and sad at times like everyone else and expresses himself through his songs. Besides, is it any different than Metallica writing yet another "The world sucks" song, Celine Dion writing another love song, a rapper writing another "I'm cooler than you" song, or a country music singer writing another "I'm a tough guy" song? ;)]]></wp:comment_content>
