		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src='http://troyandgay.com/pix/jonmegan.jpg' alt='' align='left' style='margin:3px;' />Jon and Megan (and Shammy) spent the weekend at our house. They came over on Saturday morning (early!) so Gay and Megan could do a 20-mile run in their marathon-training. We barbecued salmon for dinner with lots of wine. We had bloody marys the next morning and sat outside in this great weather we're having and had afternoon beers. This was the first weekend we've had to relax all year almost, and just in time from spring. We've promised ourselves that we'll work a more sane schedule this year, so I'm looking forward to the most relaxing summer we've had in years. :)]]></content:encoded>
