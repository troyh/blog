It's a good description of how cool RSS is and personal RSS aggregators are the future of news delivery. I just found <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> which is nice.

Years ago at Stream, I did 3 projects in succession that were all "personal news services" and I was pretty excited about having computers pick news just for you. Back then, it was not very easy since you needed a lot of newsfeeds with a lot of meta info already pulled out, plus, without the , all the transport mechanisms were custom (remember Lotus' NotesNet??). RSS makes it possible with real humans doing the news selection.]]></content:encoded>
