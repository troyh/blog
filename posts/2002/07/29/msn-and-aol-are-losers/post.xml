MSN and Earthlink have about 600,000 broadband subscribers, analysts say, more than AOL in absolute numbers and far more as a percentage of their total customers... Earthlink's average revenue per user is $20.75, $2.57 more than AOL's, even though Earthlink's posted price is $21.95, $2 less than AOL's. (MSN, which had revenue of about $1.5 billion for the fiscal year ended in June, has an average revenue per subscriber of only about $11, not enough to make the service profitable.)]]></content:encoded>
