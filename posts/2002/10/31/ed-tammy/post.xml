		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ed (of Ed &amp; Tammy, our pig-farm neighbors) dropped by this morning. He was worried that the Asplundh markers on the trees to be trimmed/removed were survey markers and wanted to know if we were upset that he parks his rusty Ford Granada on our property and he said he'd get rid of the dead cars in his "driveway". He also tells us (Gay) that they are going to sell the house and move because of problems with the Knox's over the years. But then again, he told us a year ago that he was going to clean up his yard.]]></content:encoded>
