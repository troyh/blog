		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another day, another brewpub for lunch. I was shocked to find out that Spokane had, not one, but two brewpubs. This time we went to <a href="http://www.washingtonbrewersguild.org/members_nlights.php">Northern Lights Brewing</a>. The beer here was much better than Steam Plant's beers. I liked almost all of their beers:

The food was much better too.

As luck would have it, Dry Fly Distillery was right next door. Gay had read about Dry Fly months ago and we made a mental note to visit it the next time we were in Spokane. So <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/08/02/dry-fly-distillery/">we went</a>.]]></content:encoded>
