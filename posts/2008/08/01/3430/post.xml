		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For lunch, we went to a brewpub right around the corner from the hotel, <a href="http://www.steamplantgrill.com/">The Steam Plant Grill</a>. This was one of the coolest interiors of a restaurant I've been in:

It was the steam plant that delivered steam and electricity to downtown Spokane until 1986. They have electricity now, so I'm not sure how long they were without electricity in Spokane.

I got the sampling of all 9 of their beers and about 4 were good, which is a pretty good ratio. I really liked their stout.

Gay went to a girls lunch with a bunch of girls going to the wedding and I took Havana back to the hotel for her afternoon nap. That night, the Murphys, long-time friends of Megan's family, had a party for all the out-of-town guests at their home. Gay's mom, dad and aunts watched Havana and Gay and I had another date. We met Jon's family and friends, had lots of food and wine and Jon was thrown into the pool.

<strong>Update:</strong> Yes, Jon was thrown into the pool by his dad. Jon then threw his brother into the pool.]]></content:encoded>
