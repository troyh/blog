		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The weatherpeople predicted snow on Wednesday and the fear of snow caused schools all over the area to preemptively cancel school. But the snow never came. It did come Thursday morning. We woke up to about a half-inch of snow and at 8:30am it started snowing and hasn't stopped by 1pm. We have about 4 inches here on Vashon.

Vashon schools were closed yesterday but not today. Kids had to go to school this morning only to be sent home at 10:30am for elementary and 12:30pm for middle and high school. Someone in the "Vashon school district":http://www.vashonsd.org/ needs to spend a little more time looking out the window and less time listening to fortune-tellers on TV.]]></content:encoded>
