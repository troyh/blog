		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The big political news today is a New York Times story about McCain and a female lobbyist. McCain staffers from his 2000 campaign were concerned that "his relationship with a lobbyist looked suspicious":http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/politics/21mccain.html. He and the lobbyist claim that they had no romantic relationship and that she didn't influence him in his policies (this must be the first time a lobbyist has ever insisted that they are ineffective!).

History is a legitimate way to defend against accusations because with people (unlike stocks), past performance _is_ an indicator of future performance. Of course, he and his supporters cite his history as a Senator to back his impartiality claims. However, they don't cite his history as a husband to refute the romantic relationship. And for good reason, "he has had several extramarital affairs":http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter5.html.]]></content:encoded>
