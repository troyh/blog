		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Slate "compares environmental differences between the paper and electronic versions of newspapers":http://www.slate.com/id/2185143/ and concludes, in my view, that it's likely a wash. Besides, over time, things that consume electricity (servers and home computers) are becoming more energy-efficient over time, which will make the electronic version the clear winner eventually.

Even so, I believe that consuming more paper is better for the environment than consuming less paper. If we use less paper, paper companies need smaller tree farms, so they sell that property which will be used for parking lots, houses, shopping malls and other things besides trees. But ultimately, I'm on the side of electronic media because it'll be less expensive to distribute, which will make more people consume it, which will make more people educated. More educated people makes it more likely that we'll solve the environmental problem through technology and innovation rather than the untenable "consume less mentality.".]]></content:encoded>
