<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/troyh/2225520109/" title="IMG_1492.JPG by troyh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2250/2225520109_3201bf6d10.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_1492.JPG" /></a>

The weather was great, the food was good and I spent most of the time relaxing and reading. I finished two books and started a third which is the most productive reading I've ever done on a vacation.

One "trick" Havana does now is to smile at the camera when she's photographed. I don't know how she learned this, but as soon as she notices the camera pointing at her, she quickly smiles. I captured a video of her doing this, which shows how she does it only for the photo as she quickly returns to whatever she was doing before the photo:

We visited the town of Bucerias for dinner and it happened to be on the final day of their town festival. The streets were crowded with food stands and there was a carnival in the town square. When we were in France in 2005, pre-baby, we stumbled on a similar festival and we watched all the kids ride the merry-go-round and all their parents taking photos of them and imagined one day we'd be those people. Here's proof:

I'm glad to be back in Seattle where I can drink good beer and wine again, though.]]></content:encoded>
