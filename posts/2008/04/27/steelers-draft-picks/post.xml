		<content:encoded><![CDATA[They haven't picked an offensive lineman, presumably because all the best linemen went to other teams ahead of them. They took a running back, Rashard Mendenhall, and a receiver, Limas Sweed.


<!--more-->

Rashard Mendenhall: He looks like a big and fast running back, which is good, but don't they need a power running back like Jerome Bettis or Franco Harris? Are they writing off Najeh Davenport already?

Limas Sweed: Since Roethlisberger is always throwing on the run, due to a lack of a good offensive line, a tall receiver like this guy should be easier to throw to.

We still need a boy's name for our upcoming baby. Rashard? No. Limas? Mmmm, no. The search continues...]]></content:encoded>
