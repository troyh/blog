They took 3 offensive players and 4 defensive players. All seem like good picks and everyone seems to be excited about Rashard Mendenhall. But don't they know they need to improve their offensive line? As one commenter I saw said after they picked a QB, "they've just added another tackling dummy."]]></content:encoded>
