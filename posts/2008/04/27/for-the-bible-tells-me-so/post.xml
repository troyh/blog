It's a documentary about how people use the Bible to oppress non-whites and women. Now that they've largely given up on oppressing non-white and women because you look like a real lunatic doing that today, it's the homosexuals' turn. Falwell, Swaggert and James Dobson rile up their armies of hate to keep homosexuals out of society. And all make $100+ million a year, tax-free, doing it (What would Jesus think of that?).

The most compelling reason Christians believe homosexuality is immoral is because, of course, the Bible says it is. They quote this:

bq. Leviticus 18:22: Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.

And this:

bq. Leviticus 20:13: If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.

But they stop reading there, because Leviticus goes on to say these things that Christians and their leaders regularly ignore:

bq. Leviticus 19:27: Do not cut the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.

bq. Leviticus 19:26: Do not eat any meat with the blood still in it.

bq. Leviticus 19:33-34: When an alien lives with you in your land, do not mistreat him. The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt.

bq. Leviticus 20:10: If a man commits adultery with another man's wife -- with the wife of his neighbor -- both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death.

bq. Leviticus 20:18: If a man lies with a woman during her monthly period and has sexual relations with her, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it. Both of them must be cut off from their people.

bq. Leviticus 20:27: A man or woman who is a medium or spiritist among you must be put to death. You are to stone them; their blood will be on their own heads.

bq. Leviticus 19:16 Do not go about spreading slander among your people. Do not do anything that endangers your neighbor's life.

bq. Leviticus 19:18: Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself.

And I love these two:

bq. Leviticus 20:15: If a man has sexual relations with an animal, he must be put to death, and you must kill the animal.

bq. Leviticus 20:16: If a woman approaches an animal to have sexual relations with it, kill both the woman and the animal. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.

So a man must be put to death for _having_ sex with an animal, but a woman must be put to death for _thinking_ about having sex with an animal. Only a man would make such a law. No god would make such a distinction. And I guess the animal must be put to death in both cases because it is partly to blame for being so attractive that it causes humans to want to have sex with it.]]></content:encoded>
