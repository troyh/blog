		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We checked out of the hotel in Monterey Saturday morning and were on the road by 9am. We arrived in San Francisco, after a couple hours touring the area in between, at 3:30pm.

Our first stop was in Los Gatos, in the mountains before we reached Silicon Valley. The town was really cute so we parked, took out the stroller and walked around for a good while. They were having an Easter Egg hunt in the yard of the high school so we took Havana there where she saw chickens, bunny rabbits and ponies. We really like Los Gatos but it was still too early for lunch so we got back on the highway.

Next stop was Apple headquarters in Cupertino:

And wouldn't you know it, there's a brewpub right next to Apple called "BJ's Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse":http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/ so we went there for lunch. Gay's getting sick of my brewpub tour, but when in Rome.... I ordered their seasonal ESB and later 4 samplers: Pale Ale, Irish Red, an Imperial Stout and their seasonal Oatmeal Stout. The ESB, pale and Imperial Stout and Oatmeal Stout were all very good. I'm usually not a fan of red ales and theirs was my least favorite of this group.

I ordered a turkey club sandwich, Gay got a mini deep-dish pizza and Havana got an appetizer sampler of avocado egg rolls, a southwestern egg roll, mozzarella sticks and artichoke and spinach dip. The food was about what you'd expect at a brewpub or even a cut above most brewpubs. If I worked at Apple, I'd be at this place often (especially with their "curbside take out":http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/curbside.aspx). It turns out that BJ's is a chain with locations across the country, but I've never heard of it since they have none in Washington ("yet":http://www.bjsbrewhouse.com/locations.aspx). I may have to stop at the one in Eugene on the way home.

After lunch, back on the highway to visit Google's headquarters and drive around Silicon Valley, through Palo Alto, around Stanford University, through Los Altos and then Mountain View. It's kinda stupid to drive around looking for the buildings of tech companies, but I was last in the valley in 1995 or 1996, straight from Virginia, and I really liked it then. I wanted to see it again to see if it was like I remembered it was. It wasn't. Lots of traffic and lots of strip malls. Still not Northern Virginia bad, but getting there. Living in Seattle for so long now must've raised my standards.

Enough of that, we headed north into San Francisco. We checked into the hotel, "Hotel Vitale":http://www.hotelvitale.com/, at 3:30.

We had a sushi dinner at "Ozumo":http://www.ozumo.com/. Pretty spendy, but Havana had her first sushi so it was priceless. I was probably 24 years old when I first had sushi, she's had sushi at 42 weeks old. She's off to a good food start.
