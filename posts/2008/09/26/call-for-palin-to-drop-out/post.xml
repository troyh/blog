		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally even the conservatives have figured out that Palin is a disaster. It was okay with them when she was just a disaster for the country, but now that they've realized she's a disaster for their party, they're singing a different tune. The conservative magazine National Review now thinks <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDZiMDhjYTU1NmI5Y2MwZjg2MWNiMWMyYTUxZDkwNTE=">she should drop out</a>:

bq. If Palin were a man, we'd all be guffawing, just as we do every time Joe Biden tickles the back of his throat with his toes. But because she's a woman -- and the first ever on a Republican presidential ticket -- we are reluctant to say what is painfully true. What to do? ... Only Palin can save McCain, her party, and the country she loves. She can bow out for personal reasons, perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn. No one would criticize a mother who puts her family first.

Agreed! I think she should just announce that her husband has entered a "Ricky Gervais":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais look-alike contest and he needs her support.

"My husband has, you know, entered a, umm, important competition, one that is critical to the future of all Alaskans... oh, and as well as Americans and their constituencies and their friends and families, a competition that will decide how closely our people compare to Mr. Gervais and to the people of other countries and faiths and religions and backgrounds and cultures and diversities and I know the American people, including Alaskans, understand how crucial this campaign is to our democracy, and the Constitution, and to our young people and leaders and military and their families so I believe that I must do what is right for my husband in his time of great sacrifice and efforts and provide my love and support and my speeching talents that have helped me very greatly in my career in politics in the great state of Alaska in his endeavor and enterprises on this day and the days to come."]]></content:encoded>
