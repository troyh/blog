		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sarah Palin's 17-year old unmarried daughter "is pregnant":http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/01/palin.daughter/index.html?eref=rss_topstories. Classic. In 2006, she was asked about sex ed programs in schools:

bq. Will you support funding for abstinence-until-marriage education instead of for explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics, and the distribution of contraceptives in schools?
SP: Yes, the explicit sex-ed programs will not find my support.

No wonder her daughter is pregnant. The abstinence-until-marriage education didn't work for her own daughter because it doesn't work period.

Refuting the Republican Party's claim that she's really smart, when asked about "Under God" in the pledge of allegiance, "she answered":http://eagleforumalaska.blogspot.com/2006/07/2006-gubernatorial-candidate.html:

bq. Are you offended by the phrase "Under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance? Why or why not?
SP: Not on your life. If it was good enough for the founding fathers, its good enough for me and I'll fight in defense of our Pledge of Allegiance

Uhhh... a person running for VP didn't know that the founding fathers didn't write the Pledge of Allegiance or that the original version did not include "Under God"? Do they have schools in Alaska? Lets ask her how to spell "potato" and see if she's even dumber than Dan Quayle.

Another question she was asked:

bq. Do you support the Alaska Supreme Court's ruling that spousal benefits for state employees should be given to same-sex couples? Why or why not?
SP: No, I believe spousal benefits are reserved for married citizens as defined in our constitution.

What a dumbass... marriage is not defined or even mentioned in our Constitution.

And, of course, she lied about not supporting the "Bridge To Nowhere". While campaigning, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/31/AR2008083102017.html">she fully-supported the project</a>.

Did McCain put _any_ thought into this pick? Come on McCain, do the right thing for the country: kick her off the ticket and pick someone with a brain.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I notice that this post was written before Sarah Palin appeared with Katie Couric in the interview that convinced the world that Palin is not ready for prime time.  Then, after the first presidential debate Palin was no where to be seen.  Meanwhile Joe Biden seemed to be on three channels at once.   Everything you say here is true.

I suspect McCain will keep her on the ticket to get the Evangelical vote, then Palin will conveniently resign so Lieberman can take over as VP.

Thanks for your post.]]></wp:comment_content>
