		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friday's (first) beer was "Anderson Valley's Hop Ottin' IPA":http://www.avbc.com/beers/ipa.html, a doubly hoppy and cloudy beer that went well with the sunny evening. I was surprised at how cloudy it was, I was expecting to find yeast still in it but there wasn't any.

After that, I had an "Alaskan ESB":http://www.alaskanbeer.com/esb.html, which we have plenty of in the fridge after "Havana's 1st birthday party":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2008/05/03/havanas-1st-birthday-party/. This was the first one I had and, maybe Alaskan beers are ho-hum to me, it was surprisingly tasty and much more clear than the IPA.
