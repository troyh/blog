		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hmmm.... by my calculations, Gay scores 5 merits and 7 demerits for a total of -2 on the "Wife's Marital Rating Scale":http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/05/marriage.html used by a respected marriage counselor in 1939.

Not only does she fail to sew on buttons or darn socks _regularly_, I have no evidence she has ever darned a single sock. Demerit! I'm sure that if she actually wore hose, the seams would be often crooked, but since she doesn't wear them, she skated by on that one. And she has worn red nail polish before, but since it's not a regular thing and because I'm a merciful husband, I didn't mark her down for that. The marriage counselor didn't even expect a score of less than 0, he'd be amazed at what I have to put up with.

It's interesting that "Can carry on an interesting conversation" and "Good sense of humor" are only worth 1 merit point. A wife with those qualities  whose only flaw is being late for appointments would score a -3. I'm surprised "Doesn't complain when husband disciplines her" isn't on the list of merits.

It's a man's world, eh?  I'd love to see the Husband's Chart.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Interesting that on this first page it's possible to earn more demerits than merits.  I score a 4 from this page alone, but only because we're church going people.

"Personally puts children to bed"?  I don't know that I've ever worn red nail polish, but I often have green toenails.  That has to count for something.

Yeah, I agree.  Bring on the husband chart.  ;)]]></wp:comment_content>
