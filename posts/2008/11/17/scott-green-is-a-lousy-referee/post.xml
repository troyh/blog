		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Steelers won and the extra touchdown that was nullified wouldn't have made a difference. But the refs in the game were worst I've seen in many years.

They correctly called the touchdown and had the players line up for the extra-point attempt before the refs in the booth stopped it to review the play to see if Polamalu scored. The result of the review was that there was nothing to review, but then the refs on the field huddled and decided, without a review, to declare the game over and the touchdown nullified.

This play was obviously a legal play and a touchdown, a novice football watcher could have seen this was clearly a touchdown. Watch the play:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/OQ50HtU6BSM&#038;color1=0xb1b1b1&#038;color2=0xcfcfcf&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1">http://www.youtube.com/v/OQ50HtU6BSM&#038;color1=0xb1b1b1&#038;color2=0xcfcfcf&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1</a>

Where was the "illegal forward pass"?!? Both were clearly backwards passes. And minutes after the game, the head ref, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Green_(American_football_official)">Scott Green</a> "admitted he screwed up":http://post-gazette.com/pg/08322/928592-66.stm:

bq. "We should have let the play go through in the end, yes," Green said.

What changed in the few minutes between his two decisions? Did he look at a review of the play? Did his memory of the play change?

They also called a pass-interference on the Steelers that was clearly not pass-interference -- the offensive player ran into the Steelers player and the Steelers player was flagged. And they called a holding penalty on another Steelers touchdown where the Steelers blocker fell down and brushed the side of another player -- the Steelers had to kick a field goal.

I generally don't like to blame the refs since there are always bad or questionable calls in every game -- life's not perfectly fair. But these refs sucked. I hope the Scott Green and his team of refs never ref another NFL game.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah unfortunately Scott Green did ref another game, and it ended up being the playoff game between the packers and cardinals. Where he missed 2 offensive pass interference calls on larry fitzgerald, a helmet to helmet call, and the last play in overtime, the facemask on aaron rogers. SCOTT GREEN SUCKS and should never ref another game in his LIFE. Another great game determined by the retarded zebras. Thumbs up to SCOTT GREEN. GOOD JOB]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[To complete my entry, the league apologized to the Giants the next day after Green completely botched the call and single handedly eliminated the Giants from the first round of the playoffs.  Sound familiar??  At least in the Giants and Niners game it was only one call.  There were at least 3 missed calls in the GB game, the Fitz offensive pass interference, the helmet to helmet hit on A-Rod on the second to last play and the obvious missed facemask or roughing call on the last play.  Great job Green-you and your daughter who made a post earlier should be really proud.]]></wp:comment_content>
