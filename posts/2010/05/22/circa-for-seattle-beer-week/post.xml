		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The second annual <a href="http://seattlebeerweek.com">Seattle Beer Week</a> came and I only made it to one event, like "last year":http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/05/13/date-night-2/. Tonight, we took the kids into West Seattle to <a href="http://www.circawestseattle.com/">Circa</a>. Circa was having a <a href="http://stonebrew.com">Stone</a> event so they had 4 Stone beers on tap: Levitation Ale, Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, Ruination IPA and Imperial Russian Stout. We'd never even heard of the first two and have never had any of them on tap. I love their Imperial Russian Stout and make it a point to get it when they make it two times a year, so I was happy to see that and knew I would have it for my dessert beer.

While we waited for a table, I went to the bar to get the Ruination IPA. I was almost done with it by the time we got our table. Gay ordered the Sublimely Self-Righteous and when I was done, I ordered Russian River's Pliny The Elder, which was also on tap. We quickly ordered food for the kids since it was getting late and they were very hungry. While they ate, we ordered our food. I got the venison braised in Stone's Imperial Russian Stout (yum!) and Gay ordered the beef. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which was huge and very good with the sweet stout. Gay and the kids got chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. A representative from Stone gave us a few stickers and we were heading to the 8:10pm ferry. The kids were very well-behaved and quiet, which is always a risk when taking them out these days, especially so close to their bedtime. It was a fun time and I'm glad I got to attend at least one event this year. Next year, I hope to do more.]]></content:encoded>
