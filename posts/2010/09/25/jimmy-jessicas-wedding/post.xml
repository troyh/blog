		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's Jimmy &amp; Jessica's wedding day. We got the kids dressed, went to Costco to get some Champagne and fruit so Gay could make a fruit salad. We fought the Spokane traffic to get to Gay's dad's house where Gay assembled the fruit salad. Then we were off to Deer Park to Gay's mom's farm for the wedding.

We met Jessica for the first time. The kids found tractors to climb on and some animals to look at before the wedding. The ceremony was short and then we had dinner. We opened a bottle of champagne and tried to share it, but that went over like a lead balloon. It wasn't a champagne crowd. The kids played with some other kids and danced the night away in the barn.
