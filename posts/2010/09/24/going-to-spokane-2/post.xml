		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were on our way out of Seattle to Spokane a little after 11am. We got there a little before 4pm and checked into the hotel,Â <a href="http://www.thedavenporthotel.com/">The Davenport</a>. The Davenport was <em>the</em> hotel in Spokane's hey-day, went abandoned for many years and was restored about 10 years ago.

Gay's dad and aunts came to the hotel to meet us and we had cocktails in the lobby restaurant before dinner. We then took a walk around downtown Spokane, happening upon the eve of the grand opening of a new Apple Store. As usual for Apple events, there were a couple guys waiting in line for the 10am opening the next day -- Spokane has weirdos who like to wait in line for no reason too. Whodathunkit that Spokane would get an Apple store?!? Either Spokane is growing or Apple is now that mainstream (I think the latter).

We walked to the Davenport Hotel's newer hotel, The Davenport Tower, which is really just across the street from the original and had dinner there in the Safari Room.
