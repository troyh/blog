		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My favorite mother-in-law made her annual visit this week. She arrived Monday, Gay and her went shopping, the kids entertained her during the day and she left Saturday.

Saturday afternoon, we went over to Jon &amp; Megan's house for a barbeque. Megan ran the Seattle Rock &amp; Roll Marathon again this year (<a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2009/06/27/seattle-rock-n-roll-marathon/">Gay ran the half with her last year</a>). Megan's parents, sister, nephew and niece, a few other friends who ran the marathon with her and other friends were also there. Jon bbq'd salmon. We left at 9:30pm and caught the 10:20pm ferry.]]></content:encoded>
