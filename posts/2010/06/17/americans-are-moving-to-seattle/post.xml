People are fleeing from Detroit and Los Angeles and people are flocking to Seattle (black represents number of people moving in and red represents moving out):

I'm not surprised, Seattle is a great place to live: temperate weather, good jobs, beautiful scenery, protected environment, great outdoor activities, progressive government. Kiplinger <a href="http://www.kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/10-best-cities-2010-for-the-next-decade.html">recently rated Seattle #2</a> in their list of top cities for the next decade. It's good for Seattle -- more people = bigger market = better services -- but I don't like the idea of Seattle becoming crowded. I moved away from the east coast (partly) because of all the people!]]></content:encoded>
