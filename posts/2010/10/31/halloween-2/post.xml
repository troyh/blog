		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Trick-or-treating is not very good on Vashon, so we took the kids to the new house for their first Halloween. Seattle is supposed to be <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/27/pf/best_trick_or_treat_halloween/index.htm">the best city in the country for trick-or-treating</a>, lucky kids. Havana was a mermaid and Hudson was a shark. We drove around Capitol Hill to see all the decorated houses. Havana pointed out every house with jack-o-lanterns out: "Pumpkins!"

We'd been hearing about 18th and 19th Avenues, which really put on a show. The streets were blocked-off to cars, but the streets were filling up even before dark and the houses we could see were elaborately decorated. It wasn't advisable to bring young kids to those streets because it was <em>too</em> scary, so we stayed on our street. Most of the houses on our street were decorated but it was more low-key.

Hudson was tired by the time we got to the end of our street and, to make matters worse, he was frightened by one house with scary music playing and a moving ghost. We made it down the other side of the street before they were both ready to quit. It took a few houses before they got the hang of trick-or-treating.

We talked to several of the neighbors, most that we'd already met, but we met a few more. We also learned that the house two doors down from us that was recently sold was bought by a couple with a 3 year-old. Another couple has twins (dressed up as Thing 1 and Thing 2) that are about 2 years old, I think, so there will be other kids Havana and Hudson's ages.

We left just after 7pm, picked up pizza on the way home and got on the 7:40p ferry back to put the kids to bed and watch the Steelers/Saints game.]]></content:encoded>
