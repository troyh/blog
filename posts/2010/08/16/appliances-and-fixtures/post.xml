		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Got up at 5:30am, had breakfast, Kelly got here a little early and we got on the 8:15a ferry. Went to <a href="http://albertleeappliance.com/">Albert Lee</a> to look at appliances, <a href="http://www.bestplumbing.com/">Best Plumbing</a> and <a href="http://www.seattleinteriors.com/">Seattle Interiors</a> to look at fixtures, had a delicious lunch and a beer at <a href="http://brouwerscafe.blogspot.com/">Brouwer's Cafe</a> and then went to Schuchart/Dow's office to tour their metal shop and their wood shop. They have a very cool office space with lots of the exposed wood and steel plating that we like. The metal shop is industrial with big steel workbenches that came from Boeing. They were building a huge steel table for a client that was going to have an ice bucket in the middle of it. I wish I had taken a photo of it. The wood shop was building a couple sets of cabinetry and, thanks to my ability to ask a lot of dumb questions, we got a little education on wood and laminates. They'll be building our cabinetry and I assume the metal shop will be making the steel for our deck railings and parts of doors.

Katie then took us to a few houses they worked on to see pivot doors they've made so we could see what we think of them and how we want ours to work. The walls in our family room will be doors that open up to create a bigger indoor/outdoor space. They're too big to be supported by hinges, so they will pivot open instead.Â We wanted to see and touch similar doors. We were concerned that they'd be too heavy and difficult to open, but they aren't. And they look very nice. We also saw a few "barn doors" in different styles that will be in various around the house. I can't wait to see what our doors are going to look like.

We learned a few things at Albert Lee:

1. All microwaves are made by either LG, Sharp or Panasonic. LG makes 80% of all microwaves, Sharp makes most of the rest and Panasonic makes a small number. Other brands put their case around them and different electronics to provide features (quick timers, reheat, popcorn, etc).

2. Microwave carousels are useless but people think they need them and won't buy one without a carousel so they all have them. Microwaves heat the food uniformly but food naturally has cold and hot spots that people think carousels eliminate. They don't. Stir the food instead.

3. Commercial Wolf stoves are made by Wolf, residential Wolf stoves are made by Sub-Zero (the parent company of Wolf).]]></content:encoded>
