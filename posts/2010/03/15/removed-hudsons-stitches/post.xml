		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We took Hudson to his pediatrician to get <a href="http://troyandgay.com/blog/2010/03/11/hudsons-first-stitches/">his stitches</a> removed. Poor guy, we had to hold him down and still so she could remove them and he got scared of the tweezers and scissors coming toward his eye. He kept yelling "Dop! Dop!" ("Stop! Stop!" in Hudson-speak) which is not fun to hear for a parent. He quickly forgot about it after it was done and we went to lunch after where he had fun playing with the salt and pepper shakers. The cut looks good so far. Hopefully it won't have much scarring, if any.]]></content:encoded>
