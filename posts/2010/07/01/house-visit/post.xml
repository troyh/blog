		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The guy from "2-D Floor Plans":http://www.2dfloorplans.com/ came to the house to make as-built drawings of the house. We left the house just after 10am to catch the 10:30 ferry and found a long ferry line. One of the slips at the dock is under repair so the ferries were delayed. We missed the 10:30 ferry so had to wait for the 11:30, which was also late. Vashon ferry riders spend a lot of time waiting.

We got to the house at 12:30 and met Doug (Schuchart/Dow) and Dan (Olson Kundig) outside. We gave Dan a walk-through of the house, Andrew from 2-D Floor Plans finished his work and we we headed back home on the 4pm ferry.

A total of 2.5 hours waiting for ferries. Why do Vashon people oppose a bridge?!? I can't wait to be living in the city again!]]></content:encoded>
