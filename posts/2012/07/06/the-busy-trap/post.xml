<blockquote>“The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That’s why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system.” This may sound like the pronouncement of some bong-smoking anarchist, but it was actually Arthur C. Clarke, who found time between scuba diving and pinball games to write “Childhood’s End” and think up communications satellites.
</blockquote>

The current politico-economic system doesn't need to be destroyed, it needs to be encouraged – Capitalism's goal is 100% unemployment.

<blockquote>The Puritans turned work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it as a punishment.</blockquote>

Religion seems to always be hypocritical, short-sighted and misguided.

<blockquote>...I’ve always understood that the best investment of my limited time on earth was to spend it with people I love. I suppose it’s possible I’ll lie on my deathbed regretting that I didn’t work harder and say everything I had to say, but I think what I’ll really wish is that I could have one more beer with Chris, another long talk with Megan, one last good hard laugh with Boyd. Life is too short to be busy.

</blockquote>

I agree!]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Troy  you have said it so well!   I am long in the tooth now and have lost so many friends That were my firends of 50 years plus. Many  I wish I had spent  more time with - I wish i had told them how much they meant to my life - how much I loved them. When they are now gone from my life, I can't say it to them.  Be close to the people that mean something to you.  Share with them while you are both alive - don't save to leave them money - share a day with them today while you are both alive to enjoy each other.
 Life! Every day  enjoy and appreciate your loved ones, family, and friends - tomorrow is a mystery to all of us as to what  will be waiting]]></wp:comment_content>
