They also gave us 2 free 512MB RAM chips and 2 (crappy, I'm sure) printers that are both free after rebates. I had to up the shipping from ground to 2-day since they ship from Memphis. Then they called me a few minutes later and told me I can save $55 if I ship it 3-day instead of 2-day. So I did that instead. Hopefully, they'll be here by Thursday, but because Monday is a holiday, maybe Friday. </p>

<p>This turned out to be better than driving to Portland to avoid sales tax because MacMall doesn't charge sales tax on WA orders and they gave the free RAM. I called <a href="http://thecomputerstore.com">The Computer Store</a> in Portland and asked if they'd also give me free RAM to match it. They refused claiming that they give "instant gratification" and "free shipping". They just lost out on $5000+ worth of sales.]]></content:encoded>
