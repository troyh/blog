		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just upgraded to a new version of a great little app that sits in my menu bar and tells me the current weather and the forecast called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/heat-meteo">Meteorologist</a>. While checking out the new features, I find this in the About screen:

<div style="border:1px;background:#dddddd;font-family:courier;">This is the final release of Meteorologist from Humongous Elephants and Tigers.  I worked on Meteo for quite some time while I attending the University of Illinois, but I am sad to announce that no future development will be done on my part (although many could have guessed that this was coming).

To those who hate my guts - you probably have good reason, and I hope your hatred is doused a little with pity.  I have been woefully behind on emails and updates.  I have plenty of excuses, but that doesn't really matter.

Meteorologist is now officially out of my hands.  I will be hunting around to find someone to take up the torch, and to try to take up the good fight.

Best of luck to everyone,
Matthew Fahrenbacher</div>

The author gets hate e-mail from people about it so he's quitting development of it. It's completely free software! The author does nothing but a positive thing and he gets hate mail about it! Never underestimate how mean people can be to other people.]]></content:encoded>
