		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I ran the farthest I've ever run on Tuesday and promptly proceeded to get sick.  Friday night was the worst with the coughing and the not sleeping.  I've lost my voice and can't swallow well. I coughed so hard, I threw up in the shower today, which is very, very weird.  I hate being sick most for the fact that it has cut into my training, and yesterday that I spent napping would have been great for a Fall run.  Troy has been a good nurse and I feel I am finally coming out of it.]]></content:encoded>
