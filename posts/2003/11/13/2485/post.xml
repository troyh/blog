The shareholder criticized them for hoarding $51 billion in cash and not paying out larger dividends.

That's like a bank robber arguing he needs to keep his loot to hire lawyers because the courts may try to take it away. Here's an idea for Microsoft: stop breaking the law and you won't have to worry about the courts. Here's an idea to the US Government: start enforcing the laws to distribute the ill-gotten gains one company holds to the rest of the industry to create more jobs and improve the economy.]]></content:encoded>
