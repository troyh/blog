		<content:encoded><![CDATA[War should start on Thursday. This is the 2nd war of my lifetime (well, there was Vietnam but I was too young to remember) and it's with the same country. Now that everything's said and done, I do looko forward to Saddam being out of power very soon. And it was a surrender-fest in '91 so I hope that this becomes the Mother Of All Surrenders. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/18/sprj.irq.troops/index.html">Reports</a> say that it's already happening. And even France <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/18/sprj.irq.france.chemicals/index.html">says it'll join the war</a> if Saddam uses chemical weapons (that he says he doesn't have).]]></content:encoded>
