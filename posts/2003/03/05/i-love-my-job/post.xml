		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some days are pretty rough and sometimes I question how much time I devote to <a href="http://recipezaar.com">work</a>, but the emails we get from people really give me a boost. Here's some from the last few days that made me particularly happy:</p>

Thanks for the "welcome."  I don't spend much time at all on the net as I am far too busy - but I LOVE TO COOK!!  That is my hobby.  I cook for myself
and three big guys (my DH and two DSs) and they love my cooking.  My good
friend <i>[name omitted]</i> (who also LOVES TO COOK) told me about your website yesterday.  When I left her house last night, I came home and logged on to your website.
<br />
<br />
I then did something that I have NEVER done and never thought I would ever do.  I stayed on your website from about 10:30 p.m. until
almost 4:00 A.M.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was totally crazy!!!  I couldn't tear
myself away from it!!!!  I kept looking at the clock on my computer screen
and telling myself - "<i>[name omitted]</i> - you have GOT to go to bed!!!!!!  I loved it!!!  It's absolutely the GREATEST!!!!!!  Thanks for coming up with such a fantastic idea and website!!!!!  Went to the store tonight and bought $130
worth of groceries - I'm ready to try some of those GREAT recipes!!!  Thanks again!!!

Hi, A friend just told me about your site this weekend. I am THRILLED
that I can key in Low Potassium and get recipes. My husband is a diabetic who
has heart and kidney problems and is on special diets. It is so difficult to
find recipes that he can actually eat. THanks for your wonderful site.

I just found your website this evening.  I have already sent e-mails
to all of my friend who are just as crazy about cooking and baking as I am, telling
them about the wonderful site I have discovered.
I have been into many sites for recipes and information, but yours, I must say,
impressed me the most.  It is totally organized, informative, etc. and is extremely
user friendly.
I LOVE IT!!!  THANKS FOR THE BEAUTIFUL WEBSITE.  LOOK FORWARD TO CHECKING IT
OUT ON A DAILY BASIS.

<p>Emails like this from people out of the blue are the reason I get out of bed in the morning and keeps me working til midnight every night.</p>]]></content:encoded>
