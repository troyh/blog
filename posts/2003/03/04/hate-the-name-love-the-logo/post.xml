I don't have much to say about it, but I am love with their logo graphic and I don't know why.  I sort of *get* that it tries to communicate the multitude of brands the conglomerate represents, but I prefer to think of it as a pixilated detail of some meaning-free photo.  I'm sure it cost at least $100k to produce, and my spirits lift contemplating the hours spent debating it within the bureaucracy -- "don't you think that red block just makes us look 'fat'?" -- but for me, it was worth it.  It is one of the prettiest things I've seen in a while...and yes, it probably does make me forget for an instant that they are <a href="http://www.altria.com/about_altria/01_04_02_kraftfoodsnorthamerica.asp">Marlboro &amp; Lunchables</a>.]]></content:encoded>
