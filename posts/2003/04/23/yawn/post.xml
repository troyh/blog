They refused to shutup so I turned on the light on the back deck and saw nothing. Then a huge <a href="http://www.loomcom.com/raccoons/">raccoon</a> ran by the door! I guess the dogs don't like raccoons. Anyway, I layed awake thinking about how to improve the caching mechanism on Recipezaar, and at 6:30 just decided to get out of bed. Of course, the dogs thought it was breakfast time. I explained it wasn't and they went back to bed and probably fell asleep within 30 seconds. Stupid dogs.

I reassembled a new server we're building because the fan noise was driving me nuts all day yesterday. Need to go make some coffee...]]></content:encoded>
