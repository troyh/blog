		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My (geeky) excitement is that I bought two <a href="http://valinux.com">VA Linux</a> machines on <a href="http://ebay.com">eBay</a>. I've always wanted a VA Linux server; they're well-built machines and they are/were the "Dell of Linux". But now that they've gotten out of the hardware biz, I think it's cool that I own a piece of Wall Street history from the great dot-com bubble -- VA Linux was the <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/log/1999/12/10/va_linux/">biggest IPO</a> in stock market history surging 698% the first day and it'll likely be a decade or more before that record is broken.

By today's standards, these machines are fairly low-powered (about 1/3 the speed of the other servers that run Recipezaar). But they were also very inexpensive and more than enough for their intended use.]]></content:encoded>
