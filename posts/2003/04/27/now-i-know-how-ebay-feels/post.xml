		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Running a store that customers enter during business hours is difficult.  Try running one that is open 24 hours a day, which can fill up or the doors just arbitrarily jam so no one can get in -- sometimes not even you.  Oh, and it is mostly obscured what the heck is going on at a given moment.  Try as you might to work all weekend and improve "door" and "product" performance...sometimes you go through severe growing pains...and the people who visit your store (for free) will complain, but more than anything you get frustrated with yourself for not being able to fix it.]]></content:encoded>
