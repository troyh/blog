We thought she may have had a stroke. We made a vet appointment and a few minutes later she threw up a huge amount of green gunk. She felt much better after that but we took her to the vet anyway. The vet thinks she just ate some toxic or just rancid food (we have a "pig farm" nearby where she goes to steal food) and gave her something that made her throw up even more to get it out. We left her there all day while they run some tests on her. Poor Illy.]]></content:encoded>
