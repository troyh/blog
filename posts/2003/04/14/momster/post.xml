Hilariously, Nancy revealed her jealously of her granddaughter (perhaps a common syndrome, I dunno, I found it facinating) and we had a regular Prozac Nation group session.  Funny.  The effortless honesty of these folks makes me proud to call them my friends and perhaps is a sharp contrast to other relationships.

Mike told me how much he loves his grandchildren too and how he wants to take his grandkids fishing and teach them stuff.  He wants to be like his dad was to his kids: available.

He told me "don't wait too long to have kids, because you don't want to miss out on really being able to enjoy being a grandparent."]]></content:encoded>
