Most ideas are pretty far out (Trump wants a chip in his contractors heads so they can understand his every desire) or practically around the corner (one gadget to replace 15 phones/computers/pdas, TiVo To Go, etc.).  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/30/technology/circuits/30moby.html?ex=1374638400&amp;en=1179f2a57a810ed1&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Moby is the only one with a truly innovative (and possible) idea</a>: design a recreational drug that doesn't hurt, i.e. not bad for you, and not addictive. "We wouldn't become a nation of addicts, because addiction would be impossible."]]></content:encoded>
