		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.perseus.com/blogsurvey/">Interesting weblogs survey</a> finds that 66% of all blogs have not be updated in the past 2 months; in fact, 25% were just tire-kickers (abandoned on the day they began). Not surprisingly, 92% of bloggers are under the age of 30, but 50% are under 19! "Active blogs were updated on average every 14 days.  Only 106,579 of the hosted blogs were updated on average at least once a week.  Fewer than 50,000 were updated daily."  In other words, what you *see* of the blogging world (high frequency posting from experts) is very different from reality of the blogging world right now.]]></content:encoded>
