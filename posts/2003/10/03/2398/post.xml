		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric Raymond</a> has decided that <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2003-10-02-014-26-OP-BZ-SW">Sun is done</a>, thanks to Linux. I'll always appreciate <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/ceo/mgt_joy.html">Bill Joy</a> because he gave the world <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi</a>, the world's greatest text editor, but I disagree that Sun's death is anything to lose sleep over. And while Java is not as dumb as C#, it's still as immature and almost as proprietary (although I was admittedly very hopeful for Java in 1996). I say good riddance to Sun's overpriced hardware and proprietary operating system.

I said in 1999 that Sun would be Linux's first casualty but it happened even faster than I thought it would. Let the bloody Windows versus Linux war begin. And this will be more fun to watch than the RIAA fight progress; there will be fewer lawsuits, at least.]]></content:encoded>
