He contended, however, that "there's no question that Saddam Hussein had Al Qaeda ties." (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-2connectsep18,1,314262.story?coll=la-headlines-world">LA Times</a>)

(<a href="http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/goto/?getPage=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elasvegassun%2Ecom%2Fsunbin%2Fstories%2Ftext%2F2003%2Fsep%2F17%2F091702041%2Ehtml&amp;return=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edrudgereportarchives%2Ecom%2Fdsp%2Flinks%5Frecap%2Ehtm">Associated Press</a>)  His team was given 3 months to find WMD, but in the 5 months since the overthrow the 1,400 person team of scientists, military and intelligence experts still haven't found anything more. (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/18/sprj.irq.blix.bush/index.html">CNN</a>)

As I recall, we were sold this war on the basis of WMD that could be used against us by terrorists...<a href="http://www.nobodydied.com">Nobody died when Clinton Lied</a>
