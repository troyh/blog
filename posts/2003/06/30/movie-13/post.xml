The acting was okay, the story ended pleasantly, but there are far better uplifting movies to see than this. I'm surprised it's rated as highly as it is. I guess it has all the bullet points to make critics happy: child abuse, disadvantaged youth, struggle, happy ending. And that subplot between Denzel and  his wife was barely involved, yet it supposedly was critical to the movie. Seems like there was a lot of missing scenes about that.]]></content:encoded>
