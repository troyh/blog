		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Got a most hilarious email from a Recipezaar member today.  We rejected a recipe they posted because (as they themselves stated in the description) it was an exact copy of a recipe already published on the site with a few amounts included so the nutritional analysis could be more accurate.  We, of course, don't like having duplicate recipes because it is more work for us (duh); and, more importantly, the people that post the original recipes certainly don't like having their recipes copied.  We have a way for anyone to submit corrections to an already posted recipe, and asked that this person submit a correction instead -- that way everyone benefits.  To this they said <i>"Uhm, fuck you. I am a unix sys admin...your letter is demeaning and nasty...But whoever the dumbass is that you hired and allowed "bread" to be entered without the amount on a few sandwiches is a fucking dumbass. And most important of all, your email response to my entry is one of the most fucking insulting emails I've ever been sent. I'm serious...."</i>  I'd love to print the whole thing here so you can judge for yourself, but I don't have to: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/russkiypenguin/52206.html">they posted about their "response to Recipezaar.com being a dumbass" in their blog too</a> where you can comment back to them.  And to quote this person: "All I have to say is the same thing."]]></content:encoded>
