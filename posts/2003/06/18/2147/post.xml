		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever hear the phrase "You learn something new everyday"? Well, I'm going to see if it's true. Each night I am going to write what I learned that day. Sometimes I may even learn two things in one day, wouldn't that be grand?! I wonder if I'd learn zero things the next day? Well, I guess I'll find out.

Of course, these won't be news events; that'd be too easy. And hopefully it will always be something of significance, not things like "I learned that there is 35Â¢ in the cushions of my couch" or "I learned that my dog likes to eat raisins" (they both do, btw).]]></content:encoded>
