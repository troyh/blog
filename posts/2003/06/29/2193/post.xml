		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, Apple introduced <a href="http://apple.com/isight">iSight</a>. I was interested, but not seriously because I've tried video conferencing before and was always disappointed. But on Saturday, my niece, who lives on the other side of the country, and I got iChat audio working. We could talk over the internet (for free!) and the sound quality was amazing. So my brother and I made a deal to both get iSights so we could video conference. He ran to his local Apple store that night and got his. And we video conferenced today and the video quality is also amazing. My iSight will be here Tuesday.

How does Apple do it? For years, the industry languished with lousy quality. But overnight, Apple made it real.]]></content:encoded>
