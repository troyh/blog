		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's becoming clear that the Iraq war was not about WMD and certainly not about liberating the Iraqi people. It was about ridding the world of a horrible dictator and someone who attempted to assassinate an ex-President. It just goes to show that anyone who trusts any political party wholesale, Democrat or Republican or whatever, will eventually be shown to be a fool. I'd like to go back to the days when our President lied about his personal life rather than his professional life. At least that didn't risk the safety of the entire US population.

I fear the Bush Administration set the state of US foreign policy back 30 years.]]></content:encoded>
