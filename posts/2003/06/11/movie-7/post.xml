		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just finished <a href="http://www.transportermovie.com/home.html">The Transporter</a>, an action movie with the guy from <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;cf=info&amp;id=1800023087">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a> (which I loved) and <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/movies/reviews/movie/386066">Snatch</a>. The plot is pretty undeveloped and oddly unexplained, but the point of the movie is the action -- which is pretty good. The initial driving scene is great (in a BMW 735!) then his choice of cars plummets throughout the movie as does the action in the car scenes. Lots of fight scenes, mostly typical, but there's a cool fight scene in oil and uses parts of a bike pretty well. Overall, entertaining but I was glad it was only 92 minutes.

Tomorrow night's movie is <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/XXX-1112845/reviews.php">XXX</a>, which promises to be the dumbest movie  since the last Steven Seagal movie.]]></content:encoded>
