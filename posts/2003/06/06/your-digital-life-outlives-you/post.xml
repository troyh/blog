Funny to think how your digital stuff can move around even after you have gone -- always could with paper too, but it would seem that the "bits" stuff should be <i>more</i> ephemeral not less.

Which raises a question:  now that all our pictures, and history (this blog) are now electronic, who will keep it up when we have gone?  Seems like there must be a decent archiving business in that.  Archiving websites/domains/content forever.  We've gradually moved super 8 to VHS to DVD...  If you know of one that already exists, comment.]]></content:encoded>
