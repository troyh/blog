Imagine going to jail for something you didn't do in your early 20s and getting out in your 40s and you get $0 to get off your feet, you can't get a job because employers don't understand the meaning of "innocent", you've been living with criminals in prison with few rules for now most of your life and have a hard time adapting to society's rules. And why do you end up this way? Because you didn't do anything! Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/daily/9511/11-15/simpson_golf_cap.gif">OJ Simpson is playing golf</a> and the Enron &amp; Worldcom execs who swindled thousands of people out of their futures are not likely to be punished as severely as these innocent people.

<b>Fun Facts:</b> It costs <a href="http://www.sentencing.org/facts.html">$23,000/yr to incarcerate each prisoner</a>. In comparison, the average <a href="http://www.libraryspot.com/know/tuition.htm">state college tuition</a> in the US is $2,848/yr. This implies that the US is 10x more concerned with imprisoning people than educating them.

There are <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/correct.htm">2.2 million</a> people in prison right now in the US. If we cut the average cost of incarceration by just $1,000/yr (4% decrease), that would be $2.2 billion in savings. That could give free college education to 785,000 people who can't afford it. In other words, for every 2.8 people in prison, 1 person gets a free education at a state college.]]></content:encoded>
