Significantly, we met a woman who was one of the early investors in <a href="http://www.homegrocer.com/">HomeGrocer.com</a> and acted as the CFO and sat on their board early on. HomeGrocer was destroyed in <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1017-269594.html?legacy=cnet">the mess that was Webvan</a>. She had some very interesting and quality advice for us.
