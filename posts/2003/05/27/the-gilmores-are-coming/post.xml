Last time dad was here, he brought his own food, which he kept in his own refrigerator, so we only ate a couple of meals together.  He also arrived on one day's notice and didn't provide a definite departure date.  As you can imagine, this did not make him the most favored house guest of 2002.

Does not working make you hungrier earlier?
