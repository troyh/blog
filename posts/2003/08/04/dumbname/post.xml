We just went through this domain name/company name search for <a href="http://www.mywireservice.com">MyWireService</a>, so I know the hardships of trying to find a spellable, pronouncable name that someone isn't already squatting on, but In2gr8.net Isnt2gr8.anything.  I almost peed my pants laughing when we called one of these squatters asking if they'd like to sell a domain we were interested in for $100 + whatever they'd paid for it so far.  "That is orders of magnitude below what we'd consider."  I tried not to LOL through my "good luck."  Maybe it makes me a socialist, but I think patents and domains should not get protection unless you actually make the thing you are patenting or use the domain for something.]]></content:encoded>
