		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We've made some pretty significant enhancements to the <a href="http://www.mywireservice.com">MyWireService beta</a>.  We now support creating your new newspaper sections, saved clippings are more accessible, and we've made it easier to get to past news, and a lot more, including working around a dumb CSS redraw bug in IE that made it almost impossible to read your news.  Did I mention that we added The Globe &amp; Mail for Bergy and we're still looking for more Canadian news sources? ;-)  We actually feel good enough to start telling people about it.  So if you have a news junkie or weblogging friend, tell them about it.]]></content:encoded>
