		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After stopping at the bakery downtown for coffee and a muffin, we took the dogs down to Lisabeulah park on the west side of the island and Ouzo got to go swimming for his 2nd time. Illy still only wades in the water and never strays too far away from us, but Ouzo just couldn't get enough of the water.

A couple kayakers from Seattle stopped for a break there too on their 2-day trip around the island (30 miles of kayaking!). As usual, they ask us what we do for a living that we can live on Vashon and everyone has the same look when we say "We run a recipe web site" and you can just see the question they're dying to ask but never do: "And what do you do with the other 23 hours a day?"]]></content:encoded>
