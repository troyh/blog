		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whoa, is the mainstream media actually starting to understand the meaning of "free software"? <a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030731.gttwtico31/BNStory/einsider/?query=Linux">The Globe And Mail</a>:

Myth: Linux succeeds only because it's free.

Reality: Linux is free, therefore hard to compete with. But it's not that it's just like free beer. It's also free like the English language, in that anyone can see how it works and add new parts that make it better. And it's free in that it runs on computers from many manufacturers, meaning more competition. Linux is also better. It's reliable. It doesn't crash much. It resists hacker attacks. With Linux you can have your cake (openness and competition) and eat it too (dependability).</i>]]></content:encoded>
