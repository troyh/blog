		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My dad was <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001644.php">recently diagnosed</a> with hydrocephalus. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed by a neurosurgeon, not a neurologist. After talking to a couple doctor friends we have, they stressed the importance of having a neurologist examine him before deciding it's hydrocephalus. And his regular doctor never suggested a 2nd opinion (or even a 1st opinion, for that matter), which seems suspect.

So I've been trying to get them to want a 2nd opinion. But they're full of excuses, such as the neurologist is 50 miles away, or "they probably don't know either" or it's just too inconvenient. Sometimes people confuse me. Before I get brain surgery, I'm going to have 3, 4 or 5 opinions. And part of the reason they're convinced their neurosurgeon is smart is because "he talks fast". That's not smart, that's a very poor bedside manner.]]></content:encoded>
