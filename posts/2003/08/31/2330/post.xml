		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Trying to continue a relaxing Labor Day weekend, woke up early (7:30am) and had coffee outside. Made blackberry pancakes for breakfast with blackberries from our yard. Rearranged some furniture and then went to install <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/08/001667.php#001667">my new hard drive</a> in a machine. No luck, a 200GB exceeds the EIDE 137GB limit so I'd lose 63GBs. Argh. Went to wash and vacuum the car with Gay and then took the dogs to the Zoomies drive-in, a Vashon Island fast food place (that should be called "Slowies"), for burgers and fries. They give the dogs free little ice cream cones, which is pretty cute. <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/04/001362.php">Ouzo</a> hates when we spray <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/templates/brand/default.asp?brand=1775&amp;aid=334009&amp;aparam=binaca">Binaca</a> in his mouth when <a href="http://www.papd.org/animal/behavior/quietcommand.html">he barks</a> at pedestrians.

Lunch outside in the end of summer Seattle weather. Back to the hard drive... after learning a lot about IDE and the <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/sizeGB128-c.html">137 GB limit</a>, and the <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/BIOS.html">BIOS</a> in a circa 1999 machine, just decided to upgrade to a later version of the <a href="http://kernel.org">Linux kernel</a> and it worked like a charm! Then dinner and the first part of <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/index_400_hv_presell.html">Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers</a>. Quiet. Relaxing.]]></content:encoded>
