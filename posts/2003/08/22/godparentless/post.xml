		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My godfather, Pat Craigen, died last week, just <a href="http://www.troyandgay.com/archives/2003/04/001368.php">four months after his wife, my godmother, Jean</a>.  I made a quick overnight flight to Spokane to attend his funeral, and I'm very glad I did.  I saw lots of old friends of my family, and, well, felt a part of someone's life.  Pat was fondly remembered by half of Spokane it seems -- my mom worked for him for 15 years and Craigens were her godparents as well.  Had you known Pat and Jean you would not be surprised that they followed each other so closely after 54 years of marriage.  Likewise, I saw one of their remaining friends, Vern, struggling to survive now that his best friends and wife Lucy are now all gone.]]></content:encoded>
