		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We went to a (co-ed) baby shower for our friends <a href="http://www.uwgi.org/directory/results.asp?id=92">Steve</a> (Biff) and <a href="http://www.uwgi.org/directory/results.asp?id=88">Renuka</a> at Raynu &amp; Paul's house. Gay won "gourmet soap" playing a baby name game. The food (flank steak and salmon) was yummy. Raynu &amp; Paul's house is very well-decorated and motivates me to start decorating our house we've been in for two years now with barely a picture on a wall.

We got them a baby car seat, a Pittsburgh Steelers bib that reads "Little Steelers Fan" and a Steelers baby bottle. Biff is a big Steelers fan and, coincidentally, I was too for years until I moved to Seattle and can't get Steeler games on TV.

Then we had to hurry and leave to catch the 11:30pm ferry back to Vashon. It seems like we're always rushing to catch a ferry.]]></content:encoded>
